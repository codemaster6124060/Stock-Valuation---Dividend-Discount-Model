:::Introduction to Dividend Discount Model:::
Dividend Discount Model (DDM) is a method valuation of a company’s stock which is driven by the theory that the value of its stock is the cumulative sum of all its payments given in the form of dividends which we discount in this case to its present value. In simpler words, this method is used to derive the value of the stocks based on the net present value of dividends to be distributed in the future.

:::Description of the Dividend Discount Model:::
A DDM is a valuation model where the dividend to be distributed related to a stock for a company is discounted back to the cumulative net present value and calculated accordingly. It is a quantitative method to determine or predict the price of a stock pertaining to a company. It majorly excludes all the external market conditions and only considers the fair value of the stock. The two factors which it takes into consideration is dividend pay-out factors and expected market returns. If the value obtained from the calculation of DDM for a particular stock is higher than the current trading price of the stock in the market we term the stock as undervalued and similarly if the value obtained from the calculation of DDM for a particular stock is lower than the current trading price of the stock in the market we term the stock as overvalued. In this method the base which the dividend discount model relies upon is the concept of the time value of money.

:::Formula of Dividend Discount Model:::
The traditional model for dividend discount is shown below with no dividend growth
P0 = Div/r
where,
​P0 = price at time zero, with no dividend growth
Div = future dividend payments
r = discount rate
The above formula comes from the formula of perpetuity where we show that the company is not growing and giving out a steady dividend every year.

P0 = Div/1 + r + Div/(1 + r)2 + Div/(1 + r)3 + ……………. = Div/r

But this is not true as a company will grow over with time too and thus the dividend distribution will also grow. Thus to take into account the growth of the company too in our calculation of dividend discount model the formula get a new shape as follows:
P0 = Div/(r – g)

This is also derived from the formula of perpetuity with the growth rate in consideration.
P0​​ = Div/1 + r + Div(1 + g)/(1 + r)2 + Div(1 + g)2/(1 + r)3 + ……………. = Div/(r – g)
P0 = Price at initial point of time zero with constant dividend growth
g = Dividend growth rate
